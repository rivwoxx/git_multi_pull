# git_multi_pull
Git Repositories Multi_Pull tool

## Usage
***
Change permission to exec .sh
```
chmod +x pull.sh 
```
Just run 
```
./pull.sh
```

This is intended to work on my system, if necessary change everything you need to adjust it to your system. 

For this to work properly you must have your directories inside a directory called “git”. 

So far, this has only been tested on Linux, but it was created with the objective to work on git-bash on Windows.

### Why the Conditional Statement?
I'm kind of an idiot and would like to minorize my error rate a bit.
